AB For several years THALES Aerospace has been developing a silicon
   micro-machined tuning fork gyroscope for military and civil
   applications. The targeted performance is: bias and scale factor errors
   of 10 degrees/h and 500ppm for a range of 1000 degrees/s.
   The technology is based on Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) on a SOI
   wafer. Associated with an in-plane design for the drive and sense modes,
   this technology leads to a high geometric precision and allows the
   realization of the sense and the drive mechanical resonators, and
   trimming elements within a single active layer.
   Good bias stability is achieved by cancelling the quadrature bias with
   electrostatic trimming.
   The signal processing of the gyro is primarily digital and consists of
   two main closed loops, for controlling the drive and sense modes, and an
   auxiliary loop for cancelling the quadrature bias.
   The typical results obtained on a demonstrator of a third generation
   device are the following: random walk=0.01 degrees/root h, bias
   instability<0.1 degrees/h, noise of 0.005 degrees/s over 0-50Hz, with a
   1000 degrees/s range (adjustable by the electronics), bias and scale
   factor errors of 8 degrees/h and 28 ppm in the temperature range -25
   degrees C, 70 degrees C, linearity error<0.1 degrees/s over 1000
   degrees/s. A high g shock test of 20000g has been carried out on a
   hardened prototype without any observable performance degradation.
